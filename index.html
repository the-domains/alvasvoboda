and think about how you want to deal with it: I&#x27;ve tried at least three approaches, including letting the corpses lie around until I could revive them over a long period of time (this resulted in a bunch of my Dwellers and guns disappearing due to an apparent automatic cleanup that happens in the game after a few days); getting rid of the bodies immediately, and retrenching to a much smaller, leaner team that was capable of keeping itself alive until I could rebuild (this had disadvantages because of the number of empty rooms in the Vault, which tend to bring in Rad Roaches and Mole Rats that are just as dangerous to the overall population as Deathclaws, when not dealt with immediately); and getting rid of not only the bodies, but the rooms they inhabited as well, resigning myself to a long period of rebuilding but making sure I had the resources to support those who were left (the most successful approach by far, but one which requires a degree of detachment and taking the long view that I find it hard to achieve, either in a game or at work). </p></div></div></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="78"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="79"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="80"><!-- react-empty: 81 --><!-- react-empty: 82 --><!-- react-empty: 83 --><!-- react-empty: 84 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="85"><p data-reactid="86">It&#x27;s hard to keep track of the abilities of team members, and keep them working on the things that improve the &quot;world&quot;
