I've been playing Fallout Shelter pretty obsessively for about a month now, on the principle that it will teach me something about my skills/responsibilities/dilemmas as a middle manager.  I have six Vaults that I manage (on my iPad and my iPhone, three each, that being the limit on a single device), which I equate to "teams" like the team I lead at the company I work for (a large Californian gas and electric utility).  Confirmation bias is definitely at work here, but I find the similarities between managing a Vault and managing a team salient.
